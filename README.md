# Bare Metal Forms and Helpers

> This is part of the Forms Project of The Odin Project‚Äôs Ruby on Rails Curriculum, which is also part of Microvese's Technical Curriculum. To make it, we followed [these tutorial instructions](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms).

![screenshot](./img/screenshot.png)

This project helped us to actually build some forms, first using nearly-pure HTML and then we went through, gradually, using the helper methods that Rails provides. Note that this project doesn't intent to provide any styles to the created views.
