# Bare Metal Forms and Helpers

> This is part of the Forms Project in The Odin Project‚Äôs Ruby on Rails Curriculum, which is also part of Microvese's Technical Curriculum. To make it, we followed [these tutorial instructions](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms).

This project helped us to actually built some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides.

## Built With

- Ruby 3.0.0
- Rails 6.1.3.2 (Ruby Gem)
- Sqlite 1.4.2 (Ruby Gem)
